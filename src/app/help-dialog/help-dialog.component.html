  <h2>Welcome to Dunedle!</h2>
  <br/>
  Can you guess the hidden character from Frank Herbertâ€™s <i>Dune</i> book series? <br/>
  <br/>
  Each guess reveals clues to help you find the correct answer: <br/>
  <br/>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="correct">CORRECT</td>
      <td class="wrong">WRONG</td>
      <td class="partially-correct">PARTIALLY CORRECT</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br/>
  Try to identify the character in as few guesses as possible. <br/>
  <br/>
  Good luck and have fun!
